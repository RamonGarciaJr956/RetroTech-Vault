## Installation

### Requirements
You need to have npm and nodejs installed **nodejs version must be greater than 20.x**.

Use the node package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en) to install all needed dependencies npm comes with nodejs.

```bash
npm install
```

Next, make sure to configure all the environment variables rename the .env.example file to just .env, and fill in all the variables.

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

What the env.example file contains.

```bash
AUTH_SECRET="" # Added by `npx auth`. Read more: https://cli.authjs.dev

```

Next, we need to push our schema to our Postgres database.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push --dialect=postgresql --schema=./schema.js --url=postgresql://[database_connection_url]
```

Finally, we need to install [stripe CLI and create a webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).

## Usage

First, we must start our express.js server.

```bash
node --env-file=.env ./server.js
```

Next, we must start listing on our local stripe webhook.

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to [change_this_to_your_domain]/webhook
```

**If you are running this locally the domain is localhost:8080**
